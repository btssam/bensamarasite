        <p>This is a video project I created for my Motion Graphics Final. It was made in After Effects.
            <br><br>
            It summarize the first few scenes of The Legend Of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, up until Link first leaves the Kokiri forest and begins his journey.
            <br><br>
            Drawings were originally done in pencil, directly referencing scenes from both the game itself and from the manga by Akira Himekawa. Then, they were hand traced and updated in Photoshop and GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program). The text is also directly from the game.
            <br><br>
            I wasn't able to complete all I had planned for the project during the school period, so it is still unfinished at this time, as I've focused on other projects.
            <br><br>
            A playable demo is included below. Check out my blog for more details about the process by clicking the button below.
