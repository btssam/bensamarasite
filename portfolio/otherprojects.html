    <div class = 'blurb'>
        <p>
        Here is a video of the school assignment I had in my third semester. I've included some of my pencil and paper designs below. We spent a
        couple classes establishing a character controller in playMaker, the health/damage systems, and the UI, using free assets. Then we were
        given creative freedom to make a platformer on our own, with intent to make it around 10 minutes long to play.

            Here is a character design of a creature called Vael I made for my first semester. It's a 2-3 page summary with some sketches. If the

            I had an assignment to write part of a cinematic in screenplay format. I included the original below (2:49 -6:19).

    <div class = 'blurb'>
        <p>
            This was my first semester Game Design course assignment to make a weapon. This was made by directly referencing the Daedric Axe from
            The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. I made this in Blender.

            This was made in my 3D Modeling course. The assignment was to model any outdoor or indoor environment, using modular development
            (making set pieces and duplicating them). I picked a simple harbor/port. This was made in Maya, The textures were free assets
            downloaded from online. This involved basic modeling and UV texture mapping. I've included a screen capture of Maya with perspectives.

    <div class = 'blurb'>
        <p>
            These were made with Adobe Illustrator as well as with Inkscape. They were for my Digital Design Concepts course. I used a reference
            photo and traced over it with vectors for the first image. For the second, I sketched the pictures of Mario and Link using reference
            images, scanned them in, and then traced over with vectors. It was a poster assignment.

        <h2>Raster Graphics</h2>
    </div>
    
    <div class = 'blurb'>
        <p>
            These were made with Photoshop for my first semester Digital Imaging and Design course. I've used GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation
            Program) for over ten years, and I'm relatively familiar with creating/editing raster graphics. The first two were done by drawing
            over a reference layer, with the circlet and sword being images taken from the internet. The last assignment shown here involved
            combining real photos of landscapes to create a unique landscape.
