        <p>
        Here is a video of the school assignment I had in my third semester. I've included some of my pencil and paper designs below. We spent a couple classes establishing a character controller in playMaker, the health/damage systems, and the UI using free assets. Then we were given creative freedom to make a platformer on our own, with intent to make it around 10 minutes long to play.
