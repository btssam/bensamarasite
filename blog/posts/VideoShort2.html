            <h2>Video Animation (update #2)</h2>


            <p>
                (November 18th, 2021)
                <br><br>
                Over the past week, I went back and finished up my Video Animation that I started in school. Using Adobe After Effects, I put
                together all the digital images I had made during school and finished up all the scenes I had planned. Most of the process was
                straight-forward, I found, I had very few instances where I had to learn something new to continue.
                <br><br>
                Some of the interesting points during development included:
                <br><br>
                - Adding the looping flame effect. I ended up using two duplicated layers, that were offset, and looping them back to the
                beginning when they reached the edge. I also had to draw a new image for the flames, which I scanned and traced over in GIMP.
                <br>
                - Generally, just how long it can take to make an animation, even when you know what you’re doing, have everything planned out,
                and have all of your images already done.
                <br>
                - There is a lot of math involved if you want things to be smooth. It’s all basic math, but it is frequent. Math like counting
                frames, counting pixels, figuring out relative scaling, and just planning around how long you want things to last in frames.
                <br><br>
                I enjoyed working on this animation. I’d like to make something more complex in the future, with actual frame-based animation
                (like a walk cycle – drawing multiple frames), instead of just mostly changing the position/scale/rotation of a single image.
                It would be best, though, to get more experienced drawing directly digitally on a tablet, rather than drawing by hand, then
                scanning, then tracing, as this takes pretty long and would really add up if I have to do a lot of frames for a short animation.
                Otherwise, Adobe After Effects itself is nice to use. It’s an effective program overall. I just am not in love with the
                Adobe pricing model and would rather just use an open source tool. Blender has some 2D animation tools and I would be looking
                toward that next for any animation I’d like to do.
