            Hello and welcome to my first blog post. In this blog, I will be discussing the process for some of my projects. 
            <br><br>
            During the Fall semester of 2019, I was in a course called Motion Graphics. In it, we used the video editing program Adobe After Effects. Our final project was an open ended video assignment, aiming for between 1-3 minutes. After some brainstorming, I decided to make my project about the first few scenes of one of my absolute favorite games, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. I soon came upon a stopping point for this project's scope, to stop the story when Link first leaves the Kokiri forest. 
            <br><br>
            My initial idea was to have it look like an old NES or SNES game cinematics, looking specifically at Ninja Gaiden (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOxZiizL4E). Though, as I began working on it this idea changed, realizing I couldn't quite recreate these cinematics as I wanted. I still integrated some of the ideology with the the sizing of the text box and the sizing of the image. I also enjoyed the idea that in NES cinematics, simple 2-frame animations are the norm.
