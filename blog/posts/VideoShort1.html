                (April 15th, 2020)
                <br><br>
                Hello and welcome to my first blog post. In this blog, I will be discussing the process for some of my projects. 
                <br><br>
                During the Fall semester of 2019, I was in a course called Motion Graphics. In it, we used the video editing program
                Adobe After Effects. Our final project was an open ended video assignment, aiming for between 1-3 minutes. After some
                brainstorming, I decided to make my project about the first few scenes of one of my absolute favorite games, <i>The Legend of Zelda:
                Ocarina of Time</i>. I soon came upon a stopping point for this project's scope, to stop the story when Link first leaves the Kokiri
                forest.
                <br><br>
                My initial idea was to have it look like an old NES or SNES game cinematics, looking specifically at Ninja Gaiden
                (<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOxZiizL4E'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtOxZiizL4E</a>). Though, as I began
                working on it this idea changed, realizing I couldn't quite recreate these cinematics as I wanted. I still integrated some of the
                ideology with the the sizing of the text box and the sizing of the image. I also enjoyed the idea that in NES cinematics, simple
                2-frame animations are the norm.

            <p>
                I reread the first view scenes in the LoZ: OoT manga (<a href='https://www.viz.com/read/manga/legend-of-zelda-volume-1/product/1890'>
                https://www.viz.com/read/manga/legend-of-zelda-volume-1/product/1890</a>) and watched gameplay footage of the first scenes in the
                game itself (<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FX8YkcOeOfQ'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FX8YkcOeOfQ</a>), up to when Link
                leaves the forest. I noted the pivotal, plot-moving scenes - dreaming of Zelda, fighting Gohma, receiving the Kokiri Emerald,
                hearing the origin of the universe, etc. I identified which ones I wanted to use as reference, and began sketching. The research
                probably took between 1-2 hours. The sketches took maybe 5 hours all together, most of which I made fairly detailed to prepare for
                scanning. I had a little story boarding experience from a previous assignment in my game design course that helped.

            <p>
                I have images of my digitally traced images that I can include here in the future. I can also show how the editing looks in Adobe
                After Effects.
                <br><br>
                Once I finish the animations I have planned, I'd plan to add sounds. Beyond that, one thing I'm considering is adding more of a
                background to each slide.
                <br><br>
                To be continued...
