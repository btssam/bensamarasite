                (November 19th, 2021)
                <br><br>
                This blog post was made mostly just to move some of the information that was on the portfolio page for my school projects to a
                separate page, so that if people are interested to learn more, they can, but are not otherwise exposed to that extra info if they
                just want to see the finished pieces themselves.
                <br><br>
                These were all done during my Interactive Media - Game Design Associate's program and were generally done in 1-3 weeks each.

                Unity Platformer Level:
                <br><br>
                This was a school assignment I had in my third semester. I've included some of my pencil and paper designs below. We spent a
                couple classes establishing a character controller in playMaker, the health/damage systems, and the UI, using free assets. 'playMaker'
                is a Unity addon that is basically a visual coding tool. Then we were given creative freedom to make a platformer on our own,
                with intent to make it around 10 minutes long to play.

                3D Models:
                <br><br>
                This was my assignment in my first semester Game Design course. The assignment was to make a weapon. This was made by directly
                referencing the Daedric Axe from The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. I made this in Blender. 
                <br><br>
                The other set of 3D models were made in my 3D Modeling course. The assignment was to model any outdoor or indoor environment,
                using modular development (making set pieces and duplicating them). I picked a simple harbor/port. This was made in Maya.
                The textures were free assets downloaded from online. This involved basic modeling and UV texture mapping.
                <br><br>
                Vector Graphics:
                <br><br>
                These were made with Adobe Illustrator as well as with Inkscape. They were for my Digital Design Concepts course. I used a
                reference photo and traced over it with vectors for the first image. For the second, I sketched the pictures of Mario and Link
                using reference images, scanned them in, and then traced over with vectors. It was a poster assignment.
                <br><br>
                Raster Graphics:
                <br><br>
                These were made with Photoshop for my first semester Digital Imaging and Design course. I've used GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation
                Program) for over ten years, and I'm relatively familiar with creating/editing raster graphics. The first two were done by
                drawing over a reference layer, with the circlet and sword being images taken from the internet. The last assignment shown here
                involved combining real photos of landscapes to create a unique landscape.
