            <h2>General Update #1</h2>

            <p>
                Hello. I would like to provide a general update on my life and game design.
                <br><br>
                On Game Design Goals:
                <br><br>
                I've been thinking one of my primary goals is to be able to scrap together my game ideas into 2d games with a minimal time loss between
                idea and concept/prototype. This is obviously a large goal and also one I've had a long time, but I've realized this would require of me
                deep proficiency with one game engine. Though I've enjoyed using Unity and GameMaker and I find Unreal appealing, I've chosen to focus on
                the Godot engine, primarily for its open-source nature. So, I've been trying to do tutorials for that more often. I'd like to do a couple
                in depth tutorials and then see how well I can put together my own game project ideas.
                <br><br>
                I've also been thinking about applying to schools for the Spring semester. I'd like to update this portfolio with some of the school
                projects I've mentioned, as well as potentially my Unity PlayMaker in-school project too before applying. There's also a design challenge
                for Champlain college that seems like it would be a good portfolio piece. It would be a tabletop game. I recognize that I could likely
                apply with my portfolio in this state, but I know I could add more to make it more appealing, and frankly, don't feel like I'm
                demonstrating nearly what I'm capable of here, yet.
                <br><br>
                I don't have any major rush to apply and find myself more inclined to work on these project for some real length. I partly want to see how
                much I am willing to devote to these projects in my free time before I overly commit to this career. Realistically, to get the Unity game
                and other school projects up as is and my other projects remain in the state they are, that would likely be good enough for Spring apps.
                I really seem to almost fear the prospect of ending up in this games program with a strong desire to simply be working on my own game
                projects, while instead I am spending my days learning specific tools I might not want or pursuing new projects when I truly should be
                finishing up some of my half-dozen half-pursued projects. I fear being rushed into the formal educational systems when I may feel my best
                education, at this point after having done so much research, lies in individual practice. I don't imagine this fear is totally valid, even
                if it is based on some important ideas, like trying it out on my own before committing. Realistically, a good bachelor's game program works
                around my educational goals or at least allows enough different classes/flexibility in projects and would potentially effectively allow me
                to continue my projects for credit.
                <br><br>
                I find it valuable to and hope to continue to have monthly, career/game design focused blog updates here. I also would like to allow
                myself to write about most anything on my mind or related here. Even if I have been focusing on other stuff, to update is a good idea.
                Even if it's "these are the games I'm playing and this is what I like about them."
