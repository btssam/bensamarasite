            <p>
                Hello and welcome to my second blog post. In this post, I will discuss my text-based adventure game that I made using the program
                Twine (<a href='http://twinery.org/'>http://twinery.org/</a>).
                <br><br>
                I've developed roughly halfway through my planned story so far. After I've done what I planned, I will be editing my writing for
                and beta testing. Somethings I'd consider adding once I'm done with the base game are more text effects like coloring, a main menu
                screen with potentially checkpoints to jump to in the story, and still images for passages.
                <br><br>
                You can download my rough story outline below as a pdf. It's about 4 pages.
                <br><br>
                I can also in the future include here my first outline that I put in my notebook as well as my notes. I'd also like to get into
                some of the reasoning behind my design and some of the basic programming at play.
                <br><br>
                To be continued...
            </p>
