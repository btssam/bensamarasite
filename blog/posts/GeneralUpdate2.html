            <p>
                (October 15th, 2020)
                <br><br>
                Lately I've been having fun with the development/programming side of things.
                <br><br>
                Some things I've been working on lately:
                <br><br>
                My Twine Game
                <br><br>
                Using the Godot Engine
                <br><br>
                Experimenting with Unix (Fedora Core 32)
                <br><br>
                I've been very interested in storytelling and writing lately, as well as sketching here and there. I recently finished a section
                of my Twine game and have been doing my usual minor editing and polishing. Using Godot seems to be a higher priority to me as it
                has much more implications than just text-based games, but working on that twine game has still been a wonderful design process.
                I am looking toward doing some Godot courses online and then trying to making some of the small-scope video games I've designed.
