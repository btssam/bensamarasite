                Hello,
                <br><br>
                Here, I provide a little context about the process of my sketches.
                <br><br>
                The two drawings of the woman were done with a live model, on large paper and an easel. They each took about 45-60 minutes
                in-class time and then another 30-60 minutes to finish the shading. The other drawings took longer and were focused more on
                contour lines. The rhinoceros took at least 6-8 hours over about 3-4 drawing sessions. This one was done relatively early on in
                my Intro to Drawing course. The other two, the set of hands and the Vitruvian Man were done in the later weeks of my Human Form
                Drawing course. I would estimate they both took at least 4 hours each.  I'd also like to note that, though these are all reference
                drawings, I enjoy doodling and sketching from my imagination at times. I have done so since I was young, but I've been drawing
                more regularly since around 2015.
                <br><br>
                These are all my after the fact estimations based on my recollection.
            </p>
