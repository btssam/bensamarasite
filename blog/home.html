                        <p>Here's a general update about what I've been working on lately. The past 4-5 months, I've been following a repeating bi-weekly schedule in which I do a different task each day. It's similar to a school schedule, in that I cover a lot of different ground of different subjects. What specifically I've been...</p>

                        I've been thinking one of my primary goals is to be able to scrap together my game ideas into 2d games with a minimal time loss between idea and concept/prototype. This is obviously a large goal and also one I've...</p>
