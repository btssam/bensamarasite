                        <p>I’ve recently reached a large milestone for my text-based game and would like to provide a bit of information about how the
                            development has been going. I recently finished all of the scenes that I had planned out in my outline and feel as if I am in a
                            spot where it is a viable game. My next steps are to move on to testing and continue...</p>

                            separate page, so that if people are interested to learn more, they can, but are not otherwise exposed to that extra info if they

                        <p>Over the past week, I went back and finished up my Video Animation that I started in school. Using Adobe After Effects, I put
                            together all the digital images I had made during school and finished up all the scenes I had planned. Most of the process was

The past 4-5 months, I've been following a repeating bi-weekly schedule in which I do a different task each day. It's similar to a school schedule, in that I cover a lot of different ground of different subjects. What specifically I've been...</p>
