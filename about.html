    <p>Hello! My name's Ben Samara and I am a game designer and devloper, as well as an art and programming generalist. I studied at Quinsigamond 
        Community College and graduated in May 2020 with an Associate's Degree in Interactive Media - Game Design. I have spent my free time 
        researching game design, art, and programming since around 2015 as well.
    <br>
    <br>
    Beyond that, I really do feel like a life-long student. I love to learn. I am deeply motivated by the arts and humanities, as well as the
    STEM fields. It's one of the reasons I am so interested in games - they combine the arts with technology and science.
    <br>
    <br>
    I currently work as Software Engineer in the Customer Experience team at Cisco Inc. I've worked there since April 2022.
    <br>
    <br>
    Thank you for your interest and your time.</p>
