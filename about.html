    <p>Hello! My name's Ben Samara. I graduated from Quinsigamond Community College in May 2020 with an Associate's Degree in Interactive Media - Game Design. I have spent my free time 
    researching game design, art, and programming since around 2015 as well. I programmed my first game for a science fair when I was in middle school in 2009. I have worked as a Software
    Engineering Contractor for Cisco, with a focus on deployments and documentation from 2022 to 2024.
    <br>
    <br>
    Beyond that, I really do feel like a life-long student. I love to learn. I am deeply motivated by the arts and humanities, as well as the
    STEM fields. It's one of the reasons I am so interested in games - they combine the arts with technology and science.
    <br>
    <br>
    In 2025, I began a double major bachelor's degree in Computer Science (B.S) and Game Development (B.S.) at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and am currently enrolled there.
    <br>
    <br>
    I find all genres of games interesting to design for, but I am most interested in role-playing games, strategies games and I have an interest in smaller, indie game companies.
    Lately, I have been into the unique play experiences of tabletop role-playing games like Dungeons and Dragons and Pathfinder. I'm also a big fan of open source software like Blender and have been
    using the Godot Game Engine for several years now.
    <br>
    <br>
    Thank you for your interest and your time.</p>
